Hi, I’m P1uto264.

I am a cybersecurity-focused developer building practical skills in
ethical hacking, scripting, and Linux-based environments.

My current focus includes JavaScript and Python for automation,
command-line workflows using Bash and PowerShell, and understanding
systems from a defensive security perspective.

I prefer learning by building and testing tools in controlled
environments, documenting what I learn, and improving through
iteration.

I am working toward a junior security analyst or SOC role and am
interested in opportunities where I can continue developing real-world
security skills while contributing to defensive security efforts.
