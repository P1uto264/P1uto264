Entry-level IT and cybersecurity learner with a strong interest in
systems, scripting, and Linux-based environments.

Currently learning JavaScript and Python, using the command line for
daily tasks, and building small scripts to automate and better
understand how systems work.

I focus on learning fundamentals, documenting what I build, and gaining
hands-on experience through labs and personal projects.

My goal is to start in an IT support or help desk role and grow toward
security-focused positions as I gain real-world experience.
